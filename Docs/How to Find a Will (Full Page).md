i) Finding a will quickly helps ensure your loved one's final wishes are honored and can simplify the estate settlement process.

### Common Places to Look

#### At Home

* Home office or filing cabinets  
* Desk drawers or bookshelves  
* Personal safes or lockboxes  
* Digital files on computer or cloud storage

#### Professional Storage

* Bank safe deposit box  
* Attorney's office  
* Estate planner or financial advisor  
* Local probate court (if previously filed)  
* Online will storage services

### Steps to Find a Will

1. Search Personal Files at Home  
* Look through folders labeled “Legal,” “Estate,” or “Personal Documents.”  
* Check any secure areas, like safes, lockboxes, or hidden drawers.  
* Don’t forget digital files—search computer folders or cloud accounts for scanned copies.

2. Contact Their Attorney  
* If you know the name of their lawyer, reach out and ask if they retain a copy.  
* Check mail or personal items for business cards or legal correspondence.  
* Attorneys often keep wills on file, especially if they helped draft them.

3. Inquire About a Safe Deposit Box  
* Contact their bank to ask if your loved one had a box in their name.  
* Be ready to provide:  
  * A certified copy of the death certificate  
  * Proof of relationship or legal authority (e.g., executor paperwork)  
* Ask the bank about the specific access process and required documents.

4. Talk to Family Members  
* Ask if anyone knows where the will might be stored.  
* Find out if your loved one ever discussed their final wishes.  
* See if someone was named executor or was present during planning.

5. Check with the Probate Court  
* Call or visit the probate court in the county where your loved one lived.  
* Some courts allow people to pre-file a will for safekeeping.  
* If you locate it, follow the court’s process for accessing or filing it.

### If You Find the Will

* Keep the original in a safe place — don’t write on or alter it.  
* Make copies for your records and for the court, if needed.  
* Contact the named executor to begin the legal process.  
* File the will with the probate court in your loved one’s county.  
* Notify the people named in the will.  
* Consider consulting a probate attorney if the estate is complex.

### If No Will is Found

If no will exists, the estate is handled according to state laws (called "intestate succession").

* A court-appointed administrator will manage the estate.  
* Close family members may need to file a petition for this role.  
* Property is typically distributed to spouses, children, or next of kin.  
* Consider speaking with a probate attorney for help navigating the process.

### Important Tips

* **Start early.** Begin searching as soon as you can after the death.  
* **Keep notes.** Track where you've looked and who you’ve contacted.  
* **Bring ID.** Be prepared to show proof of relationship or executor status.  
* **Ask for help.** If things get complicated, don’t hesitate to contact a probate lawyer.
