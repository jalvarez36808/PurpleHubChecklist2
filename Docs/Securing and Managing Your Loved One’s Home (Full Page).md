### Securing and Managing Your Loved One’s Home (Full Page)

If your loved one lived alone, securing their home is an important step in settling their affairs. Taking action early can help prevent security risks, property damage, and missed bills while allowing time for thoughtful decisions about the home’s future.

### Steps to Secure the Home

#### 1\. Lock & Secure the Property

* Ensure all doors, windows, and gates are locked.  
* Collect spare keys from family, friends, or neighbors.  
* If necessary, change the locks to prevent unauthorized access.  
* Notify a trusted neighbor or local authorities if the home will be vacant.  
* Remove valuables if the home will be empty for an extended time.

  #### 2\. Notify Key Contacts

* Inform the homeowner’s insurance provider to keep the policy active.  
* Notify family members, neighbors, or a property manager about who will check on the home.  
* If the deceased was renting, contact the landlord to discuss lease termination or next steps.

  #### 3\. Manage Mail & Deliveries

* Forward mail through **USPS Mail Forwarding** to prevent buildup.  
* Cancel subscriptions (newspapers, magazines, meal kits, etc.).  
* Regularly check the mailbox for important documents or bills.

  #### 4\. Maintain Utilities & Property Upkeep

* Keep electricity, water, and heat on if needed to prevent weather-related damage.  
* Arrange for yard care, snow removal, or general maintenance to keep the home looking occupied.  
* Ensure trash and recycling services continue or are paused if the home will remain vacant.  
* Address any urgent repairs (e.g., leaks, plumbing, pest control) to prevent damage.

  #### 5\. Consider Home Security

* Use timers for lights to make the home appear lived in.  
* Check or install a security system if needed.  
* If the home has smart locks or cameras, ensure they are monitored or disconnected.

  ### Planning for the Home’s Future

Once the home is secure, decisions will need to be made about its long-term future:

* **Mortgage or Rent Payments** – Determine if there is an active mortgage or lease and arrange payments if needed.  
* **Estate Executor’s Role** – If the home is part of the estate, the executor should review legal documents regarding ownership and responsibilities.  
* **Selling or Transferring Ownership** – If the home will be sold or inherited, consult with a real estate professional or attorney for guidance.

Taking these steps ensures your loved one’s home is protected, prevents unnecessary stress, and allows time for careful decisions. If you need guidance, consider speaking with a real estate attorney, estate planner, or property manager.
