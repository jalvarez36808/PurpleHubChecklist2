## Life Insurance (Pop-up) \- Filing a Life Insurance Claim 

Filing a life insurance claim can feel overwhelming after losing a loved one. Here's a simple, step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

**1\. Contact the Insurance Provider**

* Call the insurance company's claims department.  
* Ask for the beneficiary claim form and information on payout options.

**2\. Gather Required Documents**

* Certified death certificate  
* Policy details and the policyholder’s personal information  
* Your government-issued ID

**3\. Choose a Payout Option**

* Lump sum payment  
* Installment payments  
* Retained asset account

**4\. Submit the Claim**

* Fill out the claim form completely.  
* Attach the required documents (death certificate, ID, policy details).  
* Submit the form online, by mail, or in person.

**5\. Follow Up & Receive Payment**

* Claims are typically processed within 30–60 days.  
* If the policy was issued within the last two years, expect a possible review.  
* Payment will be made via check or direct deposit once approved.

**Additional Considerations**

* If the policy was through an employer, contact HR to start the claim process.  
* If there is no beneficiary, the payout may go to the estate and require probate.  
* Accidental death claims may need additional documentation.  
* If the claim is denied, you can appeal or seek legal assistance.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to the insurance provider for support.
